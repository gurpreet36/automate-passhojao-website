# automate-passhojao-website
in this project, i have build an automation script using puppeteer in this script the user automate notes keeping site (passhojao.com) to  to download notes.

the script works in the following ways:-
1)first it open website page and enter your credentials to log in
2)after that it open study material from that site 
3) then it download the notes from that site for you 
4) and an pdf file will be open in browser and then save it your directory ,manually because puppeteer doesn't automate any crome feature.

note : 
to run the project:-

first create  the credentials file where you enter the email ids ,pwd by which you login into the site
after than run pep file in terminal to run the project
